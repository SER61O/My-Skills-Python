# My-Skills-Python

Those where my first skills learned at the [Bootcamp Data Scientist] of Datademia in [Python] subject. I finished this Bootcamp 28/11/2021 and Python subject on 06/11/2021

This Bootcamp included other contents about [Basic statistic] [MySQL] [R] [Git] and the most important skills where Data structuration- Descriptive analysis- 
Machine learning with KNN, Random forests, KMeans & Clustering, Neuronal networks ( Tensor Flow) - and Git versions to work.

I love Python and actually I am doing all the work I can on this language ( even I learned to do many same tasks on R) with Jupyter notebook. 

So if you like to see my evolution I suggest you to visit other repositories like the work I am actually doing for the University of Vigo.
